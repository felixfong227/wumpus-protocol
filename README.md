# Wumpus-Protocol

⚠️ Nothing serious here

## Why?

A "WIP" or thought of creating a standardized protocol for bots inside Discord to intercommunal with each other, like an HTTP(S) call, but instead of settings up a server to listens for traffic, why don't we just use a text channel to do all of that?

## More details about this project

The draft schema for the Wumpus-Protocol can be sceen in the "schema_v1.jsonc" file


And I also wrote an example code inside the "scratch_book" directory
